### What is Screeps?
From the steam page:
"Screeps is an open source MMO RTS sandbox game for programming enthusiasts, wherein the core mechanic is programming your units AI. You control your colony by writing JavaScript which operates 24/7 in the single persistent open world filled by other players on par with you."

Basically it's an RTS where you have to code what all your units and structures will do, with a high degree of complexity. The learning curve is pretty steep, which is why I've made this open source bot.

### What is AozinBot?
This is simply just the code I am running on the public server. It is in no way perfect, and is currently still heavily in development. Some code will be messy/inefficient/bad or all 3. If you have any suggestions, please just message me and I'll see if I can implement them!
This code is loosely based off Overmind by Ben C Bartlett (https://github.com/bencbartlett/Overmind), although a lot of the code is original now. Although I used for inspiration, a lot of the code they use is incredibly complicated for me to understand, so I tried to make it simple, so it's easy for someone to modify if they wish!

### Installation
Just copy main.js into your screeps folder. The project uses rollup to combine all the typescript code into a single file so this is all you need. If you wish to modify the code, either clone or download the repository.
